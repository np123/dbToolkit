# dbToolkit

dbToolkit is a collection of cross-platform modules whose logic is based upon design theory for relational databases. dbToolkit combines the user's domain knowledge with principles such as Armstrong's axioms to provide a basis for good database design through the normalization of relational schemas

### Design

dbToolkit is designed using the [Qt] framework and uses [PyQt5], a set of Python bindings for the Qt application framework.


### Implementation

dbToolkit is currently being developed using Python 3. 

Creating analogous java implementations (straight port or otherwise) with similar functionality is an anticipated future endeavour in which case a 'java' directory will contain said implementations
