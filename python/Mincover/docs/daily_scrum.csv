Meeting(date, minutes)
2017-03-28 17:36:10,"Yesterday, I researched agile development and the scrum method before deciding to undertake it for this project. I created the key scrum artifacts including a Product Backlog, and a Sprint Backlog, and additionally separate logs of sprints and tasks. They are stored as a sqlite database and are also being written to file and placed under version control. I started tackling story 7 last night (part of my first sprint) and what remains is testing. Testing of specifically that portion will be done by my next daily scrum aka log entry. The challenges facing me are a lack of familiarity with testing frameworks for Python, as well as time needed to complete the implementation."
