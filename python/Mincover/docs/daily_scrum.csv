Meeting(date, minutes)
2017-03-28 17:36:10,"Yesterday, I researched agile development and the scrum method before deciding to undertake it for this project. I created the key scrum artifacts including a Product Backlog, and a Sprint Backlog, and additionally separate logs of sprints and tasks. They are stored as a sqlite database and are also being written to file and placed under version control. I started tackling story 7 last night (part of my first sprint) and what remains is testing. Testing of specifically that portion will be done by my next daily scrum aka log entry. The challenges facing me are a lack of familiarity with testing frameworks for Python, as well as time needed to complete the implementation."
2017-03-29 18:26:47,"First sprint is underway, one story (pid = 7) completed. Took a bit more work than expected, because autmoating GUI testing can be a bit troublesomein nature. The product can now save and reload its own data. Functionality has been integrated and tested. Today - the next 24hr stretch - will be spent working on the other task in the sprint backlog - testing whether a set of FDs are indeed a minimal cover. I will finish the implementation and integration by tomorrow, as well as starting testing"
2017-03-30 21:43:21,"Having a daily scrum around a consistent time is a bit of a challenge, might need to rethink the timing a little. Since yesterday, I did finish integrating the ability to test if a set of FDs are a minimal cover, by reworking and adapting the user interface. Modularity and separation of concerns are an integral part of any good design, and thankfully the integration went rather smoothly. I have a potential basis for testing the equality of two sets of FDs, but more work is needed before I can claim to have finished. Testing hasn't started, but the design and implementation is being made keeping testing in mind, so it is expected to get finished on schedule (by the 31st)"
2017-03-31 18:35:50,"Didn't realy make much visible progress other than planning at all today, but my deadline in keeping with the sprint is the end of the day (by the time i'm due for my next retrospection) between 1 and 2am. As such it's time to hit the code and get finished"
2017-04-01 20:29:22,"First sprint is complete, also marked the current version of the product as a beta release. Next step is backlog refinement followed by the start of the next sprint."
