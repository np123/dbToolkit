2017-03-29 01:28:26,"Well, this is my first retrospection since adopting scrum. It's a bit odd, seeing as I'm just a single developer, so the daily scrum is essentially a log with me taking all roles and essentially thinking from different perspectives. Adopting an agile methodology is (surprisingly) already influencing me towards making cleaner, more organized code - this is because instead of leaving out testing or doing testing (unit and system) all near the end, the idea is that at the end of each sprint the product should be in a tested and deliverable state."
2017-03-29 01:28:30,"On a more personal note, using sprints is helping me stay motivated by developing with a more goal-oriented approach, and I expect definitive measures of my progress. Although, despite all the apparent benefits that I perceive, I must admit that I am appalled, I am aghast, completely dismayed, at the lack of or incompleteness of documentation for libraries (I am in this case referring to PyQt bindings for the Qt framework). Most of the documentation is somewhat non-descriptive or leave the user travelling through numerous references based on inheritance, etc. What dismayed me greatly though, was that the documentation with regards to making a native QFileDialog was actually misleading - I was lead to believe that was only possible through the static (and predefined?) methods. Thankfully, StackOverflow is quite the resource. One thing that frankly, really annoyed and upset me was that despite the seemingly adequate QTest module, using their standard method QFileDialog.getOpenFileName provide no means for simulating a file selection. That lead me to dissect and write some of my worst code ever (purely for debugging, and now deleted) in order to figure out their hidden implementation (to no avail, I might add). Now I am left having lost half a day and making a minor (and it should really be unnecessary) adaptation of my code so I can fully automate testing. (It might be worth considering a test-driven development approach, though that's something I'm more likely to research and try out with whatever next project I start/work upon"
2017-03-30 01:30:14,"I added some extra functionality, but what I did not realize was that in doing so I would have to rework the user interface to accommodate for the need for multiple views contained within the main window. Luckily, thanks to my modular design, I only needed to add a couple of lambda methods (to accommodate for the changing of pages) and nothing more - proof of low coupling between the logic&data and the view. Even more fortunate, though due to design not luck, is that my automated testing requires no changes to adapt to the modified user interface. I will need to of course add another set of test cases for the new functionality, but that's a separate matter."
2017-03-31 02:48:30,"Did a fair amount of work and thinking about the project today, mostly bugfixes (but not actually bugs just inconsistencies from changing the UI structure) and ensuring that the reworked user interface was being integrated smoothly. Still thinking about the best way to check that a set of FDs is indeed a cover."
2017-04-01 01:51:54,"Writing callbacks, working with the Qt framework, debugging and testing the GUI and related methods - it's all becoming more familiar and intuitive to me. I'm making a lot more progress in shorter periods of time. The project seems to be progressing well."
