2017-03-29 01:28:26,"Well, this is my first retrospection since adopting scrum. It's a bit odd, seeing as I'm just a single developer, so the daily scrum is essentially a log with me taking all roles and essentially thinking from different perspectives. Adopting an agile methodology is (surprisingly) already influencing me towards making cleaner, more organized code - this is because instead of leaving out testing or doing testing (unit and system) all near the end, the idea is that at the end of each sprint the product should be in a tested and deliverable state."
2017-03-29 01:28:30,"On a more personal note, using sprints is helping me stay motivated by developing with a more goal-oriented approach, and I expect definitive measures of my progress. Although, despite all the apparent benefits that I perceive, I must admit that I am appalled, I am aghast, completely dismayed, at the lack of or incompleteness of documentation for libraries (I am in this case referring to PyQt bindings for the Qt framework). Most of the documentation is somewhat non-descriptive or leave the user travelling through numerous references based on inheritance, etc. What dismayed me greatly though, was that the documentation with regards to making a native QFileDialog was actually misleading - I was lead to believe that was only possible through the static (and predefined?) methods. Thankfully, StackOverflow is quite the resource. One thing that frankly, really annoyed and upset me was that despite the seemingly adequate QTest module, using their standard method QFileDialog.getOpenFileName provide no means for simulating a file selection. That lead me to dissect and write some of my worst code ever (purely for debugging, and now deleted) in order to figure out their hidden implementation (to no avail, I might add). Now I am left having lost half a day and making a minor (and it should really be unnecessary) adaptation of my code so I can fully automate testing. (It might be worth considering a test-driven development approach, though that's something I'm more likely to research and try out with whatever next project I start/work upon"
